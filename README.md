Embedded Programming Project
==============

Project about measuring Temperature and humidity using STM3210C board connected to an AVR processor.

The code is everything that the project needed to run.

**Iosif:**

My contribution in this is the implementation of the user interface (Screen-funtions.c, LCD.c, MenuScreens.c).

Also I have done some conrtibutions to the UART.c about the communication. Mostly debbuging the code and reviewing it.

**Panagiotis:**

My contribution is the hardware setup, the UART communication and the implemantation of the control unit (main.c, UART.c,  CU.c).

I also contributed to the user interface (Screen-funtions.c, LCD.c, MenuScreens.c). Debbuging and reviewing the code.
