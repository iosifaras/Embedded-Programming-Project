Embedded Programming Project
==============

Project about measuring Temperature and humidity using STM3210C board connected to an AVR processor.

The code is everything that the project needed to run.
My contribution in this the implementation of the user interface (Screen-funtions.c, LCD.c, MenuScreens.c)
Also I have done some conrtibutions to the UART.c about the communication. Mostly debbuging the code and reviewing it.

Some screenshots of the project:
